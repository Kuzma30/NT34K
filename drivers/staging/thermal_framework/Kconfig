menuconfig THERMAL_FRAMEWORK
	bool "Thermal Framework support"
	help
	  This is a generic thermal framework which will
	  be used as a central hub for sensors, governors
	  and cooling devices to register and pass data
	  to them.

config THERMAL_FRAMEWORK_DEBUG
	bool "Thermal Framework Debug support"
	depends on THERMAL_FRAMEWORK && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Say 'Y' here if you want to have the debugfs support for
	  the Thermal Framework. The debugfs support will create
	  debug files under DEBUG_FS to represent the thermal
	  components, e.g. thermal domains, governors, sensors and
	  cooling devices and their attributes.

config OMAP_THERMAL
	bool "OMAP Thermal Framework support"
	help
	  This is the thermal framework support for OMAP4
	  processors.
